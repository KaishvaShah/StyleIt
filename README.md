1. Partly Proposed solution to the problem is to use Seq2Seq model with attention to achieve sentiment transfer. 
   - July'22
   - As suggested in the 2017 google paper, attention is an extremely powerful tool if we want to work on transforming the inputs effectively.
2. Learnt the basics of NLP and implemented plenty of neural networks.
   - May'22
   - The resources shared by the mentor were mighty helpful in starting to learn NLP from scratch, from there on I found my way through sites and learnt pretty much everything required for the problem.
3. Implemented speech recognition using pipeling and non pipeline method.
   - June '22
   - Hugging face was used to use the pipeline library and go about implementing speech recognition. Also a non-pipeline method using processors and feature extractors was used to implement speech processing and many other examples in the underlying arena.
